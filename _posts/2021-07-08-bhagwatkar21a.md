title: Paying Attention to Video Generation
abstract: Video generation is a challenging research topic which has been tackled
  by a variety of methods including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational
  Autoencoders (VAE), optical flow and autoregressive models. However, most of the
  existing works model the task as image manipulation and learn pixel-level transforms.
  In contrast, we propose a latent vector manipulation approach using sequential models,
  particularly the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Further, we propose a
  novel Attention-based Discretized Autoencoder (ADAE) which learns a finite-sized
  codebook that serves as a basis for latent space representations of frames, to be
  modelled by the sequential model. To tackle the reduced resolution or the diversity
  bottleneck caused by the finite codebook, we propose attention-based soft-alignment
  instead of a hard distance-based choice for sampling the latent vectors. We extensively
  evaluate the proposed approach on the BAIR Robot Pushing, Sky Time-lapse and Dinosaur
  Game datasets and compare with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Upon experimentation,
  we find that our model suffers mode collapse owing to a single vector latent space
  learned by the ADAE. The cause for this mode collapse is traced back to the peaky
  attention scores resulting from the codebook (Keys and Values) and the encoderâ€™s
  output (Query). Through our findings, we highlight the importance of reliable latent
  space frame representations for successful sequential modelling.
