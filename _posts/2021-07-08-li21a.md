title: On the Low-density Latent Regions of VAE-based Language Models
abstract: By representing semantics in latent spaces, Variational autoencoders (VAEs)
  have been proven powerful in modelling and generating signals such as image and
  text, even without supervision. However, previous studies suggest that in a learned
  latent space, some low-density regions (aka. <em>holes</em>) exist, which could
  harm the overall system performance. While existing studies focus on empirically
  mitigating these latent holes, how they distribute and how they affect different
  components of a VAE, are still unexplored. In addition, the hole issue in VAEs for
  language processing is rarely addressed. In our work, by introducing a simple hole-detection
  algorithm based on the neighbour consistency between VAEâ€™s input, latent, and output
  semantic spaces, we propose to deeply dive into these topics for the first time.
  Comprehensive experiments including automatic evaluation and human evaluation imply
  that large-scale low-density latent holes may not exist in the latent space. In
  addition, various sentence encoding strategies are explored and the native word
  embedding is the most suitable strategy for VAEs in language modelling task.
