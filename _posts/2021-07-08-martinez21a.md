title: Confronting Domain Shift in Trained Neural Networks
abstract: Neural networks (NNs) are known as universal function approximators and
  can interpolate nonlinear functions between observed data points. However, when
  the target domain for deployment shifts from the training domain and NNs must extrapolate,
  the results are notoriously poor. Prior work has shown that NN uncertainty estimates
  can be used to correct binary predictions in shifted domains without retraining
  the model. We hypothesize that this approach can be extended to correct real-valued
  time series predictions. As an exemplar, we consider two mechanical systems with
  nonlinear dynamics. The first system consists of a spring-mass system where the
  stiffness changes abruptly, and the second is a real experimental system with a
  frictional joint that is an open challenge for structural dynamicists to model efficiently.
  Our experiments will test whether 1) NN uncertainty estimates can identify when
  the input domain has shifted from the training domain and 2) whether the information
  used to calculate uncertainty estimates can be used to correct the NN’s time series
  predictions. While the method as proposed did not significantly improve predictions,
  our results did show potential for modifications that could improve models’ predictions
  and play a role in structural health monitoring systems that directly impact public
  safety.
