title: 'Robustness May Be at Odds with Fairness: An Empirical Study on Class-wise
  Accuracy'
abstract: 'Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made significant advancement,
  however, they are widely known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial
  training is the most widely used technique for improving adversarial robustness
  to strong white-box attacks. Prior works have been evaluating and improving the
  model average robustness without class-wise evaluation. The average evaluation alone
  might provide a false sense of robustness. For example, the attacker can focus on
  attacking the vulnerable class, which can be dangerous, especially, when the vulnerable
  class is a critical one, such as ""human"" in autonomous driving. We propose an
  empirical study on the class-wise accuracy and robustness of adversarially trained
  models. We find that there exists inter-class discrepancy for accuracy and robustness
  even when the training dataset has an equal number of samples for each class. For
  example, in CIFAR10, ""cat"" is much more vulnerable than other classes. Moreover,
  this inter-class discrepancy also exists for normally trained models, while adversarial
  training tends to further increase the discrepancy. Our work aims to investigate
  the following questions: (a) is the phenomenon of inter-class discrepancy universal
  regardless of datasets, model architectures and optimization hyper-parameters? (b)
  If so, what can be possible explanations for the inter-class discrepancy? (c) Can
  the techniques proposed in the long tail classification be readily extended to adversarial
  training for addressing the inter-class discrepancy?'
