title: 'SFTrack++: A Fast Learnable Spectral Segmentation Approach for Space-Time
  Consistent Tracking'
abstract: 'We propose an object tracking method, SFTrack++, that smoothly learns to
  preserve the tracked object consistency over space and time dimensions by taking
  a spectral clustering approach over the graph of pixels from the video, using a
  fast 3D filtering formulation for finding the principal eigenvector of this graphâ€™s
  adjacency matrix. To better capture complex aspects of the tracked object, we enrich
  our formulation to multi-channel inputs, which permit different points of view for
  the same input. The channel inputs are in our experiments, the output of multiple
  tracking methods. After combining them, instead of relying only on hidden layers
  representations to predict a good tracking bounding box, we explicitly learn an
  intermediate, more refined one, namely the segmentation map of the tracked object.
  This prevents the rough common bounding box approach to introduce noise and distractors
  in the learning process. We test our method, SFTrack++, on five tracking benchmarks:
  OTB, UAV, NFS, GOT-10k, and TrackingNet, using five top trackers as input. Our experimental
  results validate the pre-registered hypothesis. We obtain consistent and robust
  results, competitive on the three traditional benchmarks (OTB, UAV, NFS) and significantly
  on top of others (by over $1.1%$ on accuracy) on GOT-10k and TrackingNet, which
  are newer, larger, and more varied datasets.'
