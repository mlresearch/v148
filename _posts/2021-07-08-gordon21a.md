title: Latent Neural Differential Equations for Video Generation
abstract: 'Generative Adversarial Networks have recently shown promise for video generation,
  building off of the success of image generation while also addressing a new challenge:
  time. Although time was analyzed in some early work, the literature has not adequately
  grown with temporal modeling developments. We study the effects of Neural Differential
  Equations to model the temporal dynamics of video generation. The paradigm of Neural
  Differential Equations presents many theoretical strengths including the first continuous
  representation of time within video generation. In order to address the effects
  of Neural Differential Equations, we investigate how changes in temporal models
  affect generated video quality. Our results give support to the usage of Neural
  Differential Equations as a simple replacement for older temporal generators. While
  keeping run times similar and decreasing parameter count, we produce a new state-of-the-art
  model in 64$\times$64 pixel unconditional video generation, with an Inception Score
  of 15.20.'
