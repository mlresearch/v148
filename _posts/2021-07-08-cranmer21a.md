title: Unsupervised Resource Allocation with Graph Neural Networks
abstract: We present an approach for maximizing a global utility function by learning
  how to allocate resources in an unsupervised way. We expect interactions between
  allocation targets to be important and therefore propose to learn the reward structure
  for near-optimal allocation policies with a GNN. By relaxing the resource constraint,
  we can employ gradient-based optimization in contrast to more standard evolutionary
  algorithms. Our algorithm is motivated by a problem in modern astronomy, where one
  needs to select-based on limited initial information-among $10^9$ galaxies those
  whose detailed measurement will lead to optimal inference of the composition of
  the universe. Our technique presents a way of flexibly learning an allocation strategy
  by only requiring forward simulators for the physics of interest and the measurement
  process. We anticipate that our technique will also find applications in a range
  of allocation problems from social science studies to customer satisfaction surveys
  and exploration strategies of autonomous agents.
