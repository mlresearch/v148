title: On Initial Pools for Deep Active Learning
abstract: Active Learning (AL) techniques aim to minimize the training data required
  to train a model for a given task. Pool-based AL techniques start with a small initial
  labeled pool and then iteratively pick batches of the most informative samples for
  labeling. Generally, the initial pool is sampled randomly and labeled to seed the
  AL iterations. While recent studies have focused on evaluating the robustness of
  various query functions in AL, little to no attention has been given to the design
  of the initial labeled pool for deep active learning. Given the recent successes
  of learning representations in self-supervised/unsupervised ways, we study if an
  intelligently sampled initial labeled pool can improve deep AL performance. We investigate
  the effect of intelligently sampled initial labeled pools, including the use of
  self-supervised and unsupervised strategies, on deep AL methods. The setup, hypotheses,
  methodology, and implementation details were evaluated by peer review before experiments
  were conducted. Experimental results could not conclusively prove that intelligently
  sampled initial pools are better for AL than random initial pools in the long run,
  although a Variational Autoencoder-based initial pool sampling strategy showed interesting
  trends that merit deeper investigation.
