title: Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning for Skeleton Action Recognition
abstract: Learning discriminative features plays a significant role in action recognition.
  Many attempts have been made to train deep neural networks by their labeled data.
  However, in previous networks, the view or distance variations can cause the intra-class
  differences even larger than inter-class differences. In this work, we propose a
  new contrastive self-supervised learning method for action recognition of unlabeled
  skeletal videos. Through contrastive representation learning by adequate compositions
  of viewpoints and distances, the self-supervised net selects discriminative features
  which have invariance motion semantics for action recognition. We hope this attempt
  can be helpful for the unsupervised learning study of skeleton-based action recognition.
