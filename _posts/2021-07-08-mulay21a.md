title: 'FedPerf: A Practitioners’ Guide to Performance of Federated Learning Algorithms'
abstract: 'Federated Learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively train a
  global model without sharing their local data. This decentralized and distributed
  approach improves user privacy, security, and trust. Different variants of FL algorithms
  have presented promising results on both IID and skewed Non-IID data. However, the
  performance of FL algorithms is found to be sensitive to the FL system parameters
  and hyperparameters of the used model. In practice, tuning the right set of parameter
  settings for an FL algorithm is an expensive task. In this preregister paper, we
  propose an empirical investigation on four prominent FL algorithms to discover the
  relation between the FL System Parameters (FLSPs) and their performances. The FLSPs
  add extra complexity to FL algorithms over a traditional ML system. We hypothesize
  that choosing the best FL algorithm for the given FLSP is not a trivial problem.
  Further, we endeavor to formulate a systematic method that could aid the practitioners
  in selecting a suitable algorithm given the FLSPs. The code for all the experiments
  is available here: https://github.com/tushar-semwal/fedperf.'
