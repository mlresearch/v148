title: Context-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning using Unsupervised Learning of Context
  Variables
abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), changes in the context often cause a distributional
  change in the observations of the environment, requiring the agent to adapt to this
  change. For example, when a new user interacts with a system, the system has to
  adapt to the needs of the user, which might differ based on the userâ€™s characteristics
  that are often not observable. In this Contextual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) setting,
  the agent has to not only recognise and adapt to a context, but also remember previous
  ones. However, often in CRL the context is unknown, hence a supervised approach
  for learning to predict the context is not feasible. In this paper, we introduce
  Context-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Agent (CARLA), that is capable of learning
  context variables in an unsupervised manner, and can adapt the policy to the current
  context. We provide a hypothesis based on the generative process that explains how
  the context variable relates to the states and observations of an environment. Further,
  we propose an experimental protocol to test and validate our hypothesis; and compare
  the performance of the proposed approach with other methods in a CRL environment.
  Finally, we provide empirical results in support of our hypothesis, demonstrating
  the effectiveness of CARLA in tackling CRL.
