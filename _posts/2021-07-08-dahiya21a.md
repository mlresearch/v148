title: Exploring self-supervised learning techniques for hand pose estimation
abstract: 3D hand pose estimation from monocular RGB is a challenging problem due
  to significantly varying environmental conditions such as lighting or variation
  in subject appearances. One way to improve performance across-the-board is to introduce
  more data. However, acquiring 3D annotated data for hands is a laborious task, as
  it involves heavy multi-camera setups leading to lab-like training data which does
  not generalize well. Alternatively, one could make use of unsupervised pre-training
  in order to significantly increase the training data size one can train on. More
  recently, contrastive learning has shown promising results on tasks such as image
  classification. Yet, no study has been made on how it affects structured regression
  problems such as hand pose estimation. We hypothesize that the contrastive objective
  does not extend well to such downstream task due to its inherent invariance and
  instead propose a relation objective, promoting equivariance. Our goal is to perform
  extensive experiments to validate our hypothesis.
