title: Testing the Genomic Bottleneck Hypothesis in Hebbian Meta-Learning
abstract: Hebbian meta-learning has recently shown promise to solve hard reinforcement
  learning problems, allowing agents to adapt to some degree to changes in the environment.
  However, because each synapse in these approaches can learn a very specific learning
  rule, the ability to generalize to very different situations is likely reduced.
  We hypothesize that limiting the number of Hebbian learning rules through a “genomic
  bottleneck” can act as a regularizer leading to better generalization across changes
  to the environment. We test this hypothesis by decoupling the number of Hebbian
  learning rules from the number of synapses and systematically varying the number
  of Hebbian learning rules. The results in this paper suggest that simultaneously
  learning the Hebbian learning rules and their assignment to synapses is a difficult
  optimization problem, leading to poor performance in the environments tested. However,
  parallel research to ours finds that it is indeed possible to reduce the number
  of learning rules by clustering similar rules together. How to best implement a
  “genomic bottleneck” algorithm is thus an important research direction that warrants
  further investigation.
