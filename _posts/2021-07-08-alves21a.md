title: An Empirical Study of the Discreteness Prior in Low-Rank Matrix Completion
abstract: 'A reasonable assumption in recommender systems is that the rows (users)
  and columns (items) of the rating matrix can be split into groups (communities)
  with the following property: each entry of the matrix is the sum of components corresponding
  to community behavior and a purely low-rank component corresponding to individual
  behavior. We investigate (1) whether such a structure is present in real-world datasets,
  (2) whether the knowledge of the existence of such structure alone can improve performance,
  without explicit information about the community memberships. To these ends, we
  formulate a <em>joint</em> optimization problem over all (completed matrix, set
  of communities) pairs based on a nuclear-norm regularizer which jointly encourages
  <em>both</em> low-rank solutions <em>and</em> the recovery of relevant communities.
  Since our optimization problem is non-convex and of combinatorial complexity, we
  propose a heuristic algorithm to solve it. Our algorithm alternatingly refines the
  user and item communities through a clustering step jointly supervised by nuclear-norm
  regularization. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge. We performed synthetic
  and real data experiments to confirm our hypothesis and evaluate the efficacy of
  our method at recovering the relevant communities. The results shows that our method
  is capable of retrieving such an underlying (community behaviour + continuous low-rank)
  structure with high accuracy if it is present. '
