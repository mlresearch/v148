title: Towards a Unified Lifelong Learning Framework
abstract: Humans can learn a variety of concepts and skills incrementally over the
  course of their lives while exhibiting many desirable properties, such as continual
  learning without forgetting, forward transfer of knowledge, and learning a new concept
  with few examples.  However, most previous approaches to efficient lifelong learning
  demonstrate only subsets of these properties, often by different complex mechanisms.
  In this preregistration submission, we propose to study the effectiveness of a unified
  lifelong learning framework designed to achieve many of these properties through
  one central mechanism.  We describe this consolidation-based approach and propose
  experimental protocols to benchmark it on several skills, using grid searches over
  hyperparameters to better understand the framework.
