title: Domain Conditional Predictors for Domain Adaptation
abstract: 'Learning guarantees often rely on assumptions of i.i.d. data, which will
  likely be violated in practice once predictors are deployed to perform real-world
  tasks. Domain adaptation approaches thus appeared as a useful framework yielding
  extra flexibility in that distinct train and test data distributions are supported,
  provided that other assumptions are satisfied such as covariate shift, which expects
  the conditional distributions over labels to be independent of the underlying data
  distribution. Several approaches were introduced in order to induce generalization
  across varying train and test data sources, and those often rely on the general
  idea of domain-invariance, in such a way that the data-generating distributions
  are to be disregarded by the prediction model. In this contribution, we tackle the
  problem of generalizing across data sources by approaching it from the opposite
  direction: we consider a conditional modeling approach in which predictions, in
  addition to being dependent on the input data, use information relative to the underlying
  data-generating distribution. For instance, the model has an explicit mechanism
  to adapt to changing environments and/or new data sources. We argue that such an
  approach is more generally applicable than current domain adaptation methods since
  it does not require extra assumptions such as covariate shift and further yields
  simpler training algorithms that avoid a common source of training instabilities
  caused by minimax formulations, often employed in domain-invariant methods.'
