title: Point Cloud Overlapping Region Co-Segmentation Network
abstract: 3D point clouds are being increasingly used in the field of computer vision
  and many applications involve the processing of partially overlapping point clouds.
  However, little attention has been paid to the property of partial overlap. In this
  paper, we propose the concept of co-segmentation of the overlapping region of two
  3D point clouds and develop a deep neural network to solve this problem. The proposed
  network utilizes co-attention mechanism to aggregate information from the paring
  point clouds so as to find the overlapping region. The co-segmentation of overlapping
  region can be regarded as a preprocessing step in practical 3D point cloud processing
  pipelines so that downstream tasks can be better accomplished. We build a dataset
  of partially overlapping 3D point clouds from ModelNet40 and ShapeNet, which are
  two widely used 3D point cloud datasets, and the overlapping region can be obtained
  automatically without manual labelling. We also utilize the real 3D point cloud
  datasets, 3DMatch and ScanNet, in which the overlapping region can be obtained from
  the relative pose between point clouds provided in the datasets. We evaluate the
  performance of the proposed method on co-segmentation of overlapping region on these
  datasets and its effectiveness in improving one downstream task, 3D point cloud
  registration, which is very sensitive to partial overlapping
