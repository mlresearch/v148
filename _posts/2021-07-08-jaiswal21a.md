title: Keypoints-aware Object Detection
abstract: We propose a new framework for object detection that guides the model to
  explicitly reason about translation and rotation invariant object keypoints to boost
  model robustness. The model first predicts keypoints for each object in the image
  and then derives bounding-box predictions from the keypoints. While object classification
  and box regression are supervised, keypoints are learned through self-supervision
  by comparing keypoints predicted for each image with those for its affine transformations.
  Thus, the framework does not require additional annotations and can be trained on
  standard object detection datasets. The proposed model is designed to be anchor-free,
  proposal-free, and single-stage in order to avoid associated computational overhead
  and hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, the generated keypoints allow for inferring
  close-fit rotated bounding boxes and coarse segmentation for free. Results of our
  model on VOC show promising results. Our findings regarding training difficulties
  and pitfalls pave the way for future research in this direction.
