title: 'PCA Retargeting: Encoding Linear Shape Models as Convolutional Mesh Autoencoders'
abstract: 3D Morphable Models have long played a key role in the construction of statistical
  shape models. While earlier models employed Principal Component Analysis, recent
  work has migrated towards mesh autoencoder models for the construction of lightweight,
  non-linear shape models that facilitate state-of-the-art reconstruction and the
  capture of high-fidelity details. Doing so results in a loss of interpretability
  and regularisation in the model latent space. To address this, we propose <em>PCA
  retargeting</em>, a method for expressing linear PCA models as mesh autoencoders
  and thereby retaining the gaussianity of the latent space. To encourage the capture
  of mesh details outside the expressive range of a PCA model, we introduce “free”
  latent space parameters. Experiments demonstrate the successful retargeting of the
  PCA models as mesh autoencoders. The introduction of “free” latent parameters have
  a greater impact when smaller latent vector sizes are used, but do not lead to any
  gains in reconstruction fidelity.
