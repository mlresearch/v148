title: Evaluating Adversarial Robustness in Simulated Cerebellum
abstract: 'It is well known that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial
  examples, in which great efforts have been made to improve the robustness. However,
  such examples are usually imperceptible to humans, and thus their effect on biological
  neural circuits is largely unknown. This paper will investigate the adversarial
  robustness in a simulated cerebellum, a well-studied supervised learning system
  in computational neuroscience. Specifically, we propose to study three unique characteristics
  revealed in the cerebellum: (i) network width; (ii) long-term depression on the
  parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses; (iii) sparse connectivity in the granule
  layer, and hypothesize that they will be beneficial for improving robustness. To
  the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to examine the adversarial
  robustness in simulated cerebellum models.  The results are negative in the experimental
  phaseâ€”no significant improvements in robustness are discovered from the proposed
  three mechanisms. Consequently, the cerebellum is expected to be vulnerable to adversarial
  examples as the deep neural networks under batch training. Neuroscientists are encouraged
  to fool the biological system in experiments with adversarial attacks.'
