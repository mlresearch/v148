title: Playing Atari with Hybrid Quantum-Classical Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Despite the successes of recent works in quantum reinforcement learning,
  there are still severe limitations on its applications due to the challenge of encoding
  large observation spaces into quantum systems. To address this challenge, we propose
  using a neural network as a data encoder, with the Atari games as our testbed. Specifically,
  the neural network converts the pixel input from the games to quantum data for a
  Quantum Variational Circuit (QVC); this hybrid model is then used as a function
  approximator in the Double Deep Q Networks algorithm. We explore a number of variations
  of this algorithm and find that our proposed hybrid models do not achieve meaningful
  results on two Atari games â€“ Breakout and Pong. We suspect this is due to the significantly
  reduced sizes of the hybrid quantum-classical systems.
